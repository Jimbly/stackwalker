Stackwalker
===========

Tool to load a .map file and callstacks or error logs and visually navigate through the stack in the original source.

Use it here: [jimbly.github.io/stackwalker](https://jimbly.github.io/stackwalker/index.html)

To use this for your own projects, you may want to clone it and modify `preparse` and `parseStack` in `main.js` to match however you are logging and receiving stack traces.
